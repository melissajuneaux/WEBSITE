    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> My name is Melissa Juneau, I am currently a student at First Nation
      Technology council. I am creating this website for personal use. Here is
      where future employers or clientele can find more personal information
      about me, what I have to offer and my future goals. <p>

    <h3>My website goals</h3>
    <p>My dream website would be Simple, Minimalistic, Neutral, Modern, and easy
      to navigate.I would like a uncluttered welcome page, with links leading
      into my subtitled pages and a hamburger menu in the right corner.<p>

    <h4>My Portfolio</h4>
    <p> I would like to create and build a portfolio to showcase my work
      to future employers or clientele.

    <h5>My Strategy</h5>
    <p> I plan on taking the advanced Digital Marketing program with the First
      Nations Technology Council. I would provide my marketing strategy here.


    <h6>Social media</h6>
    <p>I do not have any public social media platforms at the moment. I am
      currently only using a private Facebook page and a private SnapChat. Once
      I brand myself and figure out what I am doing, I will post my social
      media tags here for everyone to follow.
